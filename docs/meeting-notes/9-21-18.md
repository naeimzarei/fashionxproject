# Agenda  
Ask to upload the pictures/logos for both PC and Mobile.-- Ashley said she'll upload it to the Google Drive folder  
Discuss schema for DB- I'll send Duke team the credentials on how to access our shared DB along with a picture of the schema


Ignacio says that they're going to bring in a "project manager" and full stack developer later on for front end development (CSS)  
Project manager will be mostly for Duke team, and will be used to address what we're doing to make sure Duke team is on track.  

Dimensions for pictures should match instagram- along with resizing pictures, and possibly filters if we have time  

Possibly pull an image from the clothes URL to display on the website when an influencer adds the clothes they're wearing. (stretch goal)  
Skype call for next week's meeting.
