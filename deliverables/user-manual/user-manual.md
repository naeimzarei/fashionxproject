# User Manual

## Signup Page
Each field of the sign up form is required except for "Blog" (which can be a link to a personal blog, if you have one). 
If you already have an account with us, go to the <a href = "/influencers/login"> login page</a> in order to login to your existing account. Otherwise, please follow the directions below.

* Input your responses for all the required fields
* Ensure you've reviewed the Terms of Service, check the checkbox, and click "Sign Up"
* You will get an email informing you whether or not you have been approved to be an influencer

## Login Page
Input the email and password you used during the sign up process. As a reminder, passwords are between 6-12 characters long, and must contain at least one number and uppercase letter. If you would like to stay signed in, please click the 'Keep me logged in' checkbox. 

If the correct email and password combination is used, you will be automatically directed to the home page. Otherwise, you will get a message
informing you that an improper email and password combination was used. 

As a reminder, if you recently submitted an application to be an influencer, you will not have access to shopherlook unless your profile
has been approved by an administrator. You will receive an email about the status of your application via email after an administrator has
checked on the status of your profile. 

## Home Page
After entering in your login credentials, you will be brought to the dashboard page where you can see all of your posts. 
If you try to input login credentials but return to the login page with a message saying "Email does not exist", this means that 
we do not have an account with those credentials in our records. Please navigate to the <a href = "/influencers/signup">signup page</a> to create an account.

On the home page, you are greeted with your posts and a couple of options. You can choose to edit, view, or delete a post to 
your liking. In addition, you can navigate to your profile by clicking the 'My Profile' button. You can also choose to make 
another post by clicking the 'Sell' button or see all your listings by clicking the 'Manage Listings' button. 

## Profile Page
When you click on the profile icon on the top right of the page, you can either view your profile, log out, or go to a page
of frequently asked questions. If you click on the 'View Profile' button, you are navigated to your personal profile. The profile
contains your profile information, such as name and email. You can update these fields and click on the 'Update' button to update
your profile. 

## Sell Page
On the sell page, you can upload your content and specify the details of your post. You must indicate whether you are selling one item
or a bundle of items, the name of the item(s), the size, the brand, the selling and original prices, the condition, as well as a short
description of the product.

In order to upload a photo of your product, click the 'Upload Picture' button and navigate to the photo file on your device. Click the
file you would like to upload and click the 'Open' button. You may only upload files that are photos. All other files are not permitted. 

When you upload an image, a cropping interface will appear where you can choose the region and zoom to your liking.
Currently, the minimum image size (width x height) is 250 x 250 with the max being 1080 x 1080 (conforming to Instagram standards)
and an aspect ratio of 1:1. Once you have finished cropping your image, click the 'Done Cropping' button. Once all the necessary fields
have been filled out properly and you have finished cropping your photo, click the 'Create Post' button to create a post.
