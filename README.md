# General Materials

## Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to add a page on the current fashionxproject website to allow 'influencers' to login, create a profile, and submit photos of their fashion content. The platform, fashionxproject, is a fashion start-up that finds clothing that looks good on people based on their body dimensions. As part of this project, the uploading of influencer profiles and content will be automated to reduce the amount of time it takes to process what is shown on the actual website to the shoppers.

## Team Rules

### Team Behavior
How long do you wait for someone to arrive at a meeting before you begin without them?
> For group meetings, we will wait up to 15 minutes for the members to show up. If not, we will continue working on the project with those that are present. For client meetings, we will wait up to 20 minutes for their arrival. If they do not come within that time slot, we will give them an immediate email notification of an alternative meeting time. In addition, we will ask them for their input on our current progress and offer ours as well via email. If necessary, we will consult whether or not it would be easier to meet online via Skype or another video conferencing interface. 

If you need an answer to a question and someone does not respond, what assumptions can you make?
> I assume whatever is consistent with team goals and client needs, as well as the guidelines set by the instructor of this course. Worst case scenario, I will wait for another time to prompt the question, preferably in-person.

At what point should team members give a heads-up if they are not going to meet a deadline? 
> As soon as possible is preferred, however try to aim for 24 hours in advance. Best case scenario, 48 hours in advance.

If something happens and the group needs to revert code changes, what will you do? 
> Each group member will have his own branch on GitHub for version control. A master branch will be used for stable code. If anything happens in one person's branch, it will not affect the master branch code. 

How will team members notify other group members if he will be late to meetings or will not be able to attend all together?
> It is expected for a group member to give a heads-up about their absence as soon as possible, preferably 24 hours in advance. The group member will notify other team members via text or email. 

If you reach a point where you and the group members cannot make an important decision, what will you do to move forward?
> We do not expect to ever reach this point with this group, but if the need arises, we will consult the client and the instructor for input. 

### Coding Practices
Each function and method in JavaScript will be documented using JSDoc. We will consider JavaScript testing frameworks, such as Jest, to test the code before pushing it to the master branch. This testing will be done under /test. We will consider JavaScript linting service to ensure that our code is up-to-date with current styling conventions. Each person will have his own branch on GitHub so that checking in and out files will not be an issue. Before merging with master branch, it is preferred that a Pull Request is submitted, but for small  changes such as CSS changes, an automatic merge will suffice. 

## Journal of Meetings
All meetings are documented under docs/meeting-notes on GitHub page.
